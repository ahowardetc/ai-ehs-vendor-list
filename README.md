## Vendor Vetting & Due Diligence üõ°Ô∏è

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up: this list is for exploration, not endorsement.**

Every tool listed here is a real company using AI in environment, health and safety ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a great fit, production-ready, or aligned with your needs, budget, or risk profile.

This resource is intended to help you explore the landscape, not make purchasing decisions. Always do your own due diligence before engaging with any vendor.

Some key questions to ask during vendor conversations:

- What kind of AI is being used ‚Äî machine learning, computer vision, NLP, or something else?  
- Is the AI explainable? How is model accuracy tested or validated?  
- Does the system produce false positives or alert fatigue, and how is that managed?  
- What data does the system collect? Who owns it? Is customer data used to retrain models?  
- Are there published case studies or independent validations?  
- What regulatory standards does the product meet (e.g., OSHA, ISO 45001, GDPR)?  
- Can alerts, thresholds, or scoring logic be customized to our context?  
- How does it integrate with our existing tools (EHS platforms, BI tools, ticketing systems)?

This is a community-built index of vendors doing interesting work in AI + EHS. It is not curated for operational readiness, maturity, or compliance suitability.
