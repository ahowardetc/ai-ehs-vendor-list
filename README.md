## üõ°Ô∏è Vendor Vetting & Due Diligence

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up: this list is for exploration, not endorsement.**
>
> Every tool listed here is a real company using AI in workplace health and safety ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a great fit, production-ready, or aligned with your needs, budget, or risk profile.
>
> This resource is intended to help you explore the landscape, not make purchasing decisions. Always do your own due diligence before engaging with any vendor.
>
> Some key questions to ask during vendor conversations:
>
> - What kind of AI is being used ‚Äî machine learning, computer vision, NLP, or something else?
> - Is the AI explainable? How is model accuracy tested or validated?
> - Does the system produce false positives or alert fatigue, and how is that managed?
> - What data does the system collect? Who owns it? Is customer data used to retrain models?
> - Are there published case studies or independent validations?
> - What regulatory standards does the product meet (e.g., OSHA, ISO 45001, GDPR)?
> - Can alerts, thresholds, or scoring logic be customized to our context?
> - How does it integrate with our existing tools (EHS platforms, BI tools, ticketing systems)?
>
> This is a community-built index of vendors doing interesting work in AI + safety. It is not curated for operational readiness, maturity, or compliance suitability.
